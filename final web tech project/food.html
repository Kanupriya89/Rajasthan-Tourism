Rajasthani cuisine was influenced by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in this arid region.Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking.
Out of all the Rajasthani dishes, dal bati churma is perhaps the best known. For those who are in a lookout for variety, Rajasthan has a lot to offer. Infact, as you travel from one part of the state to another, you'll find that every region has something unique, which reflects in its food as well. <br>

The use of pure ghee, gram flour, lentil, bajra, chilies, corn, and mango powder is very common in most dishes cooked in Rajasthan. While talking about Rajasthani food, it is imperative to mention the most popular and common dish of Rajasthan - dal (lentil), bati (baked wheat ball), and churma (sweet cereal cooked in ghee). Almost all the regions within Rajasthan have their local flavors to offer while you are on a tour to Rajasthan, namely, ghevar of Jaipur, mawa kachori of Jodhpur, malpuas of Pushkar, and sohan halwa of Ajmer. 
Sweets are an integral part of Rajasthani food which are not merely used as desserts, but are consumed before and even along with the meals. Some most popular sweets of Rajasthan include Besan chakki, dilkhushaal, churma, balushahi, motichoor ladoos, and ghevar.
Rajput cuisine is of course, royally rich in meat preparations, especially game such as wild boar, hare and game birds. One of these mogul preparations is the safed maas (white meat), a traditional Rajasthani delicacy and is a must eat for every foreign traveller. The secret of its grand taste is in the gravy, which in turn is a perfect amalgamation of onion, ginger, garlic paste, salt, pepper, cashew nut paste and cardomom. Chumks of mutton (with bones) are cooked in this gravy and fresh cream is added just before serving. Be it sin any form, Rajasthani food is impeccable.
