<p class="para">Shahi Gatte (and sometime known as Govind Gatte), is deep fried besan (chickpea) dumpling that is stuffed with a generous amount of indigenous nuts.
Usually made of curd, the gravy of this dish is thick, delicious and can be enjoyed with a portion of rice or hot rotis.

Rajasthani curries are generally made with curd and one of famous curries is Gatte ki sabzi.I am a big fan of gatte ki sabzi which is Chick pea flour dumpling steamed and used in mildly spiced yogurt curry. The shahi version of making this gravy more rich is using mawa in this gravy and the original gatte are stuffed with mawa and dry fruits. Gatte ki sabzi is normally made with no onion no garlic  and When i was thinking about No onion No garlic curries the first thing came to my mind was gatte ki sabzi but since I have already done posting them this is the shahi version i wanted to post for long. I can have them as is as am a big fan of gattas but this rich gravy tastes yummy with any Indian bread. We enjoyed it for dinner yesterday with hot phulkas. You can stuff with grated paneer even instead of mawa it will taste delicious even. I don't know the history why this gatta curry  is called govind gatte they can also  be called as shahi gatte.
