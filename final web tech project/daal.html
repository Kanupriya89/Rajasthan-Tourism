<p class="para">A meal in Rajasthan is incomplete without Dal Bati Churma, one of Rajasthan's most savoured, complete meals. The dish itself consists of Dal (Lentils), Baati (wheat bread balls) and Churma (Sweet powdered cereal), served with red chilli on top of it along with spicy garlic chutney with dry fruits like cashew, pistachio, almonds or raisins.</p>
<p class="para">
The wheat bread ball is dipped in pure ghee and served hot in an earthen pot with a small vessel of Dal, red chilli, spicy garlic chutney.
It is an Indian dish comprising dal (lentils) and baati (hard wheat rolls). It is popular in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (especially in Braj, Nimar and Malwa regions).
</p>
<p class="para">Dal is basically prepared using tuvaar dal, Chana dal(prepared by removing skin of split chickpea), Mung dal, Moth dal, Urad Dal. All these pulses/lentils are cooked together after being soaked in water for a few hours. First a small amount of vegetable oil is heated in a frying pan and then the seasoning rai-jeera (mustard and cumin seeds) is added into the hot oil. Then green chilli, garlic and some spices including hing, red chilli, haldi, coriander, ginger are added. There may be a sweet and sour version of dal in some regions. And finally, the boiled daal is added and cooked. 
</p>
<p class="para">Baati is a hard bread made up of wheat flour commonly known as aata. Wheat flour is kneaded with little bit of salt, dahi(yogurt) and water. Tennis ball-sized round balls of this dough are cooked in well heated traditional oven. When the "baati" becomes golden brown in colour, it is greased with ghee and is then served with dal, rava ladoo, rice, pudina chutney, kairi (rawmango) chutney, green salad with lots of onion and fresh buttermilk (chass).
