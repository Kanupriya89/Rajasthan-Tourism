<p class="para">A breakfast in Rajasthan can be accompanied by a delicious Kachori, but one can enjoy this sweet and spicy snack any time of the day.</p>
<p class="para">
Kachoris have been an integral part to the Rajasthan cuisine for quite some time now. Two famous variations of this snack are; the Pyaj Kachori (Onion Kachori), which is filled with a spicy onion filling, and Mawa Kachoris, filled with the sweet scented blend of mawa (condensed sweet milk) and nuts.
</p>
<p class="para">Rajasthani restaurants that opened chains across India are credited with spreading the popularity of this snack across the country.
It is a spicy snack from the Indian subcontinent; popular in India, Pakistan and other parts of South Asia. It is also common in places with South Asian diaspora, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Alternative names for the snack include Kachauri, Kachodi and Katchuri. 
</p>
<p class="para">Kachoris have been popular in old Delhi and Kota, Rajasthan , even before samosas gained popularity after the partition. Banarasidas, the author of biographical Ardhakathanaka, has mentioned buying Kachoris in Agra in 1613. For seven months, he bought a ser of Kachoris daily, and owed twenty rupees.
