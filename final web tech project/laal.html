<p class="para">Laal Maans contains spicy, mouth-watering tanginess of a traditional Rajasthani dish. A red, spicy meat curry that's straight out of the Royal kitchens of Rajasthan, this dish is prepared using prime portions of mutton that's marinated in curd and spices.</p>
<p class="para">
The dish is a result of the extreme heat and limited access to water that was prevalent in this region. Its unique preparation style serves the purpose of preserving it well after it's cooked and the spices enhance ones immunity and metabolism. Laal Maans is best relished with rotis and rice.
</p>
<p class="para">It is a meat curry from Rajasthan, India. It is a mutton curry prepared in a sauce of curd and hot spices such as red chillies. This dish typically is very hot and rich in garlic, the gravy may be thick or liquid and is eaten with chapatis made out of wheat (usually eaten in summers) or bajra (a millet grown in Rajasthan and eaten in the winter months). 
</p>
<p class="para">Chef Bulai Swain said that: "Traditionally, laal maans was made with wild game meat, such as boar or deer and chillies were used to veil the gamy odour of the meat. It was a favourite among the royalties. While the spicy flavour is remained intact now, the meat used is tender mutton."
